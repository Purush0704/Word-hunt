# Word-hunt

We used emu 8086 to write our code basically we assign our required string(s) in the code itself in an order for Which it gives our output in that manner we will assign 
dimensions for our emulator screen we declare a large area of 128 random characters in the emulator screen then we will set the segment registers 
and we will call The input words i.e. the predefined words into the loop, we will index for the word pointer and then decide the Word direction how it should represent
in the emulator screen after some internal memory allocations it will exit To the operating system then the letters will be printed all across the 
emulator screen.
